# Netflix-static-webpage
I developed a Netflix-inspired static landing page using HTML and CSS to replicate the visual appeal and layout of the original Netflix homepage. The design includes key sections such as a hero banner with a background image, navigation bar, call-to-action buttons, and responsive layout to maintain structure across different screen sizes.
