ðŸ”¥ Netflix Static Landing Page
I developed a Netflix-inspired static landing page using HTML and CSS to replicate the visual appeal and layout of the original Netflix homepage. The design includes key sections such as a hero banner with a background image, navigation bar, call-to-action buttons, and responsive layout to maintain structure across different screen sizes.

Tools Used:
ðŸ”¹ HTML5 â€“ for structuring the content
ðŸ”¹ CSS3 â€“ for styling, layout, responsiveness, and hover effects

Key Features:
âœ… Fully responsive design
âœ… Clean and modern Netflix-style UI
âœ… Recreated key UI sections including the header, feature content, and footer
âœ… Smooth hover effects and button transitions

This project demonstrates my ability to translate real-world designs into functional front-end layouts, focusing purely on styling and responsiveness using just HTML and CSS.
